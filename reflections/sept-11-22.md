## **_If you had the programming skills to create anything, what would you build?
**_

If I could  make anything, I would probably make a videogame of some kind, I have always been in love with the experiences and thrills that can be created through the interactive storytelling and gameplay of these experiences, although making a game is much more than just programming, there is art direction, voice acting, sound and music, etc. So, if I had to choose something that was only programming, I would try to make some instruction tool like Scratch or something similar, as I have very fond memories of early learning tools like that, and it would give people the power and abilities to create the things they imagine, like it did for me.

**SSR for weeks 3 & 4**

* I was eventually able to get some working code for the Koko banana eating exercise
* Did my laundry at my new apartment and only messed up a little
* Built a working linked list class in Python
* Build a table
* Got a better idea of the pros and cons of Arrays as compared to lists and other data structures included in python



**Goals for weeks 5 & 6**

* Have some fun in VR and talk about its application and future in the tech industry
* Learn the situations a Stack or Queue would be used and how to implement one in the most efficient way possible
