## **_Write as if it's the end of the semester. Finish this paragraph:_**

How I earned my A in CMSI 2120 was through perseverance and self-confidence. I have always struggled with motivation and feeling like I have skills in computer science, as it is inherently very precise and demanding, while also being extremely complicated and not allowing you to fully know every detail of what is happening. It always feels like a million things could go wrong, and they often do. In order to get my A, I had to not be hard on myself and keep pushing through the chaos while doing my best to learn about the ways organizing data can impact program design and performance.

Dear future Wesley,
How's it going being a data structures MASTER who can do EVERYTHING EASILY?!?!?!
HAhaha just kidding man, you know me, always goofin around aren't I me you we so silly.
Anyhoot, I suppose if I wanted to tell you anything, I would just say good job.
It's never going to feel easy and completely comprehensive and like you can understand everything. Scrambling around to cobble together something that works with half knowledge of a bunch of disparate scattered systems is the core workflow of any and every computer scientist.
Don't ever beat yourself up about what you should know or how you will never be able to focus or be confident.
That is hokey and you know it.
Coming back from what we did, just being able to scramble throughout college is an accomplishment, and believe it or not, you are very very far from the worst student in college.
I'm proud of what I've been able to do already, and thinking about what I'll have made it through by the end of the semester is really exciting.
Keep flailing around, and maybe someday you'll be able to make a BOIDS simulation with Quad Trees and know all about how to link a list.

**SSR for weeks 1 & 2**

* Moved into my Apartment
* Refreshed by knowledge about sorting types and linked lists
* Learned about the physical memory storage in a computer and how it corresponds with program efficiency
* Braced myself for learning python
* Broke down the process of autocomplete on a technical level



**Goals for weeks 3 & 4**

* Memorize the differences in both functionality and efficiency of various list types in python
* Get a clear idea of what types of functions are available by default for python lists (sorting or appending or accessing etc)
