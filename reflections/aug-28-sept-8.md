Dear future Wesley,
Hows it going being a data structures MASTER who can do EVERYTHING EASILY?!?!?!
HAhaha just kidding man, you know me, always goofin around aren't I me you we so silly.
Anyhoot, I suppose if I wanted to tell you anything, I would just say good job.
It's never going to feel easy and completely comprehensive and like you can understand everything. Scrambling around to cobble together something that works with half knowledge of a bunch of disperate scattered systems is the core workflow of any and every computer scientist. 
Don't ever beat yourself up about what you should know or how you will never be able to focus or be confident.
That is hokey and you know it.
Coming back from what we did, just being able to scramble throughout college is an accomplishment, and belive it or not, you are very very far from the worst student in college.
I'm proud of what I've been able to do already, and thinking about what I'll have made it through by the end of the semester is really exciting.
Keep flailing around, and maybe someday you'll be able to make a BOIDS simulation with Quad Trees and know all about how to link a list.
